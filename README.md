Have a lot of tracks in your Spotify library that belong to albums you haven't explicitly added to your library? So now when you wanna browse your library by albums, there's barely anything? Me too. So I made this script (largely generated by ChatGPT).

It fetches all the tracks in your library, compiles a list of albums, filters out the ones already in your library, then asks you one by one if you would like to save them to your library.

#### How to use?

1. Create an app on [Spotify Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Copy Client ID and Secret into the code (i.e. `_kClientId` and `_kClientSecret`). Redirect URL can stay the same.
3. [Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
4. Clone this repo and open it in your Terminal
5. Run `dart pub get`
6. Run `dart run`

When you sign into Spotify in your browser, it'll redirect you to a page that doesn't exist and you'll have to manually copy the authorization code from the url. 

Example:
```http://localhost:6060/callback?code=ACQde2NfJq-this-is-a-long-code-g3amGoFBayQ```

From that, take: `ACQde2NfJq-this-is-a-long-code-g3amGoFBayQ` and paste into the app.
